This repository contains solutions to most of my solved SPOJ problem. You are free to use it as a reference, but DO NOT
COPY/PASTE!

There are many problem solvers who try very hard to solve a problem. But sometime, they are stuck at some problem,
unable to figure what is missing in their solution. It may be some corner case, optimization trick or efficient algorithm.
I have been through it, and I am sure many of you have. In such cases, after spending hours/days, online resources have
helped me a lot. This repository is meant to serve as refernce to those problem solvers. Use this as reference only
after you have tried very hard solving some problem.

Happy coding!
